# __The top 10 restaurant App__

This is my first app in pure JavaScript language.
I wanted to indicate on my current skills which I gained after watching tutorials, studying stackoverflow and many of different forums. 

I realize that I'm at the beginning of my programming trip. However I'm really determined to study more and more to be the best in this profession. 

Currently, I'm looking for my first job, intern to still improving my skills. I'm living in Rzesz√≥w but there is no problem for relocation. 

I will be glad to consider my profile and 

Have fun with __Top 10 restaurant in the city__!

## __Technologies used to build this project__

    - Basic animation/ transition
2. __JavaScript__-

    - DOM
3. __API__
    - to build this project I used a free Zomatoo API

### __What next to improve in this project?__

I'm going to implement a few more tasks in the future:
